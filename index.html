        <h2 class="section-title">Reflections</h2>
        <p class="sub-title">College, Career & Plans - Overview</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-work-2">College is one of the most challenging experiences of my life, to be honest I really don't know what I've got myself into when I enrolled into the BS - Information Systems track in De La-Salle College of Saint Benilde. Even though I encountered a lot of hardships and challenges throughout the years I learned how to appreciate a lot of things within my course as a lot of my curiosity is being satisfied and at the same time my social connections and my knowledge improves continuously. Overall, I gained a lot from all of the experience both positive and negative which made me who I am today.</p>

        <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-work-2">What’s next for me? I will continue to pursue more knowledge and will try to gather more experience as time goes by. Career-wise, I would like to focus first in finishing my internship and would like to see what other career choices I can go into.</p>

        <p class="sub-title">Internship Learnings - Overview</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-work-2">I'm currently an intern assigned at the UnionBank of the Philippines Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Group specifically in the AI and Data Policy Unit, under AI and Data Governance Office. My mentor as the data governance officer tends to guide and show me the ropes on what our team “Data Governance Office” contributes in the business. Most of the works includes data along working together with various stakeholders including other teams. It is our task to inform, advise, and issue recommendations to the PIC or PIP; ascertain renewal of accreditations or certifications necessary to maintain the required standards in personal data processing</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-work-2">Due to the confidentiality and nature of work, I cannot disclose any files related to my internship. Though as I'm still currently working as an intern from UnionBank, I still have a lot to learn in this field of work as initially I expected it to go smoothly but as time goes by there are lot of things that I need to know within the business and technology required in the projects I'm involved in. Overall, I'm very interested and curious in what and where this experience will allow me to go and reach into.</p>
